Definitions/System Description
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Coordinate frames
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The primary coordinate frames are the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

world frame
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (the virtual environment) and the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

room frame
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (the physical space of the VR system).
 Initially they are aligned, but navigation is performed by changing the
 relationship between them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On the technical side, the projection matrices are fixed such that the room
 doesn't move, and so to navigate we actually move the world.
 This is functionally equivalent to moving the room in the world, but inverse.
 This technicality may be confusing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Tracked coordinate frames
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The pose of the user's head and other input devices are also tracked (situating
 a coordinate system at them in some standard or known location), with the
 transform reported with respect to the world frame.
\end_layout

name "sub:assume-4dof-nav"

\end_inset

Navigation in 4 degrees of freedom (3 translation, and rotation about 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 - the direction of gravity) is both sufficient, and preferable to full
 6DoF navigation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "sub:assume-one-size-doesnt-fit-all"

\end_inset

Navigation techniques are an open field, so no single technique should be
 imposed on all applications.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "sub:assume-incremental-common"

\end_inset

Incremental navigation is the more common scenario (as opposed to absolute
 navigation).

\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
Full Description
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
User actions in an application may need to be interpreted with respect to
 the world frame or the room frame.

\begin_layout Section
Requirements
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Navigation must update the transform between the room and the world frames
 based on user input.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
Rationale
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is the motivating purpose of navigation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Navigation must be able to update in such a way to simulate user translation
 and rotation about the 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 axis.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
Rationale
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is effectively walking/hovering in 3D and turning without changing
 the direction of gravity to reduce DoF from a full 3 translation and 3
 rotational DoF.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
History
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Initially only translation was supported, based on the idea that we have
 a C6 and body-based rotation is superior.
 However, not having rotation has been shown to be insufficient - you don't
 usually have a C6.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The initial navigation system does support rotation (about the 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 axis at the room origin) but only for user-defined navigation functions,
 not the default.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
The relationship between user input and transform updates (
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

navigation function
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

) must be separate and able to be defined by an application.
\end_layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
History
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Potentially more than one navigation function should be supported simultaneously.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
Rationale
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Consider, for example, having a redirected-walking-in-place with a gamepad
 for precision movement.
 Each frame, the sum of translation and sum of rotation updates are applied.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This should integrate well with Actions - multiple Actions should be able
 to submit navigation updates without having to know about each other.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
A default navigation function must be provided.
\end_layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 - so unless an application specifies otherwise, navigation should be provided.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
The default navigation function should allow 4 DoF navigation.

\begin_layout Paragraph*
History
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The previous version of navigation only allowed translation, resulting in
 difficult situations in immersive environments and use of simulated head
 movement controls in a simulator environment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
The default navigation function should be allowed to be replaced.

Questions

\begin_layout Standard
Perhaps defaulting to rotation about head position projected on the

 plane? (user-centric rotation)

\begin_layout Paragraph*
History
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Initially all rotation was about 
\begin_inset Formula $y$

 axis at room origin, which isn't too natural feeling.

\begin_layout Subsection
Absolute changes to navigation state (set/reset) must be supported

Questions

\begin_layout Standard
Do we require the specification of a full transform matrix here?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
Rationale
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
May want to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 or programmatically move to a different part of the world, despite assumption

.
 That assumption also indicatest that the importance here is that the interface
 exists, and not necessarily that it is ideal - it may evolve over time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Easy access to the room-to-world and world-to-room transforms must be provided.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Navigation actions must be able to be validated, by e.g.
 some physics or collision detection
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
Questions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lots - do we just make collision detection an additional Action that applies
 navigation updates when the user is somewhere they shouldn't be? (essentially
 penalty-based - problems include tunnelling.) Do we have a stack of navigation
 validating functions that are called before any navigation change is incorporat
ed into the navigation matrix?
