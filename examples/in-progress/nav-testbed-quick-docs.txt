--[Lua basics/differences from C++:
No semicolons needed.
Use a colon to perform an action on an object ( someObject:someAction() ) instead of dot

-- Types of nodes:
--  Geodes (nodes with GEometry - parts of models)
--  Groups (any node that can have children)
--    Transforms (groups that change how their children are drawn)

-- Creating transform nodes/groups --

-- Creates a new PositionAttitude transform
someName = osg.PositionAttitudeTransform()

-- Set the position to (0, 0, -10) (a three dimensional vector)
someName:setPosition(osg.Vec3d(0, 0, -10))

-- Set the rotation to be 180 degrees about the Z axis (0, 0, 1)

-- A "Quat" (quaternion) is a way of specifying a 3d rotation
-- Here, we specify angle (in radians) and axis (a vector) to create a Quat
myQuat = osg.Quat(3.1415926, osg.Vec3d(0, 0, 1) )

-- Now, we set the rotation ("attitude") to be that quat
someName:setAttitude(myQuat)

-- Adding children --
parentnode:addChild(childnode)

-- navtransform is the root node's name in NavTestbed - if you want something
-- to show up, it has to be a child/descendent of navtransform somehow
-- (there can be transforms in between)

-- Loading a model --
myModelVarName = osgLua.loadObjectFile("c:/path/to/modelfile.ive")
