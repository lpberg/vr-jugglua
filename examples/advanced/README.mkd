# NOTE about advanced examples 

This is not one of those cases where "advanced" means "better". Here, 
"advanced" means "older" and not making use of the newer, improved 
interfaces. If you aren't planning on seriously poking around in VR 
JuggLua's innards, I'd suggest ignoring this folder completely.
